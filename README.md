This section is intended to provide you with a quick glance at our progress and 
imminent goals. It is not a complete development roadmap.

### Current

*   Input handling
    *   Correct behaviour requires changing the windowing/event library (GLFW)

### To-Do

*   (Re-)Integrate physics engine
*   Behaviour/AI scripting framework
*   glbinding -> globjects (or maybe even Vulkan-Hpp)
