Phantom Drive
=============

Description
-----------

Phantom Drive *was* the working title of a game based on the anime
series *Gen'ei wo Kakeru Taiyou*. That project is on hold indefinitely. I have
long since learned that if you want to write a game, you should probably start
with an existing engine and also have at least a vague concept of the kind of
game you intend to make.

Phantom Drive *is* a practice ground for learning about programming. It is
what I hack on to learn about language features, rendering techniques, and
software architecture.
